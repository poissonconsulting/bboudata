\description{
Data are simulated with \href{https://poissonconsulting.github.io/bbousims/}{\code{bbousims}} package.
This is a population spanning 20 years with negative trend on female adult survival
and additional annual variation on female adult survival and female calf survival.
Coverage is medium, with 50\% of groups observed and 25 collars.
This dataset follows the methodology described in DeCesare et al. (2012) for estimating
population growth rates using calf/cow age ratios.
